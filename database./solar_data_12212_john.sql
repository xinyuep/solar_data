Please let us know the price of an appropriately sized system, ground mounted, and trenched approximately 150-200 feet from the junction box. Also try and give us an idea of the footprint of the system. And finally we want to make sure that the system completely zeros out our bill every month keeping in mind that we are already skimping on power as is and we would like to have some extra headroom of poower than we currently use so that we don\'t have to huddle in a single room of our large house afraid of running the dishwasher. :-)\n\nI hope that provides some guidance as to what we are looking for.

He added a wall in the middle of his house so his brother can live in half and he can live in the other half. He also had a licensed contractor install an air conditioning unit, the contractor did not get the permits for that though and the city does not know about that. \nNow when he wanted to get solar installed the job was canceled because the city said even know you have your permit you never had the final inspection. The city did not approve the solar permit.\nIs paying 5-600.00 a month i do not know if the electricity was divided with the house when they put the wall in.\nHe is willing to sign a release of liability so that if someone got in trouble for doing this for him he will say it is all his fault and will take full responsibility\n\n\n-- 5/31/2016 @ 02:53 PM -- Email sent: Monster Solar\n-- 5/31/2016 @ 12:53 PM -- (510) 207-7252 -- Left VM/E MAIL (cold)\n-- 4/27/2016 @ 1:49 PM -- (510) 207-7252 -- Left VM (cold)\n','42471.54722','','0','0','Restricted','JOHN','RUN 1,run 3,run2','6.21','Comp Shingle Roof','TRUE','PG&E','PPA','Residential','41656.76319','','','','','','','','','','','42564.79722','4','VOICEMAIL/E MAIL','johnnybegood','ali','Sina'),('Ramirez, Clemente','','','','cramirez@yahoo.com','2096769014','','Mobile','','','','','','','','','','','','','9246 Westside Blvd','','Atwater','','95301','',' -- 6/23/2016 @ 12:24 PM --\nSPK.
